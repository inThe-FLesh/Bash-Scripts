# Bash-Scripts
This is a repository containing the bash scripts I use

## Installation
To install just clone the repository and, either cd into the repository and run them from there, or add them to /usr/bin/ to run them from the command line.

## Scripts:

### generate_sources
This script can be used to generate a list of the source files in a given directory with a given extension.

I use this mainly for generating sources for meson.build files.
